This is a TODO list to track progress and the tasks assigned to either Aditya or Sambhu.
## TODO List (Aditya & Sambhu)
- [x] Create files for defining all the constants used in the manuscript [**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Create a file for defining the $\rho_r$ and $\rho_a$  condition checks for a given set of parameters [**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Test with a random set of values for the assumption constants and check if all the $\Delta$'s return valid values (no NaN or absurd numbers) [**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Verify that the constants match those in the manuscript [**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Ensure that the code is written for general systems and remains consistent with the variable types and names defined by Aditya.[**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Identify the correct assumption constants for the vector fields defined for the Double Integrator example [**Sambhu**] 
- [x] Validate whether there exist ρᵣ and ρₐ for the above vector fields  [**Sambhu**] 
- [ ] Plot the sample paths of the nominal and true system along with the covariance ellipsoids (using a package)   [**Sambhu**] 
- [ ] Compute the 2-Wasserstein distance and check if the theoretical bound is not violated for all $t \leq T$   [**Sambhu**]
